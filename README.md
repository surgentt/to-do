# Remote 

* A remote is for collaboration. It points the information to another point in time. 

## Why use multiple remotes?

* Open source projects, you use a fork
* Origin is your personal fork
  * Basically a clone. 
* Eventually if you get access to main repo
  * You can get access to the main remote
* Rails is your personal repository tha tyou are pulling from.
